Kestrels, Quirky Birds, and Hopeless Egocentricity
==================================================

This web site began when I started to apply some of the ideas from Combinatory Logic to my daily programming. Combinatory Logic is a fascinating subject in its own right, and stands beside the Lambda Calculus as one of the foundations of Computer Science. What makes it so interesting to me is that in addition to being a powerful theoretical basis for reasoning about computers, it is chock full of ideas that are surprisingly practical for day-to-day programming.

I've blogged about some of the applications of Combinatory Logic to my Ruby programming: [Kestrels](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/tree/master/2008-10-29/kestrel.markdown#readme), [The Thrush](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/tree/master/2008-10-30/thrush.markdown#readme), [Songs of the Cardinal](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/tree/master/2008-10-31/songs_of_the_cardinal.markdown#readme), [Quirky Birds and Meta-Syntactic Programming](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/tree/master/2008-11-04/quirky_birds_and_meta_syntactic_programming.markdown#readme), [Aspect-Oriented Programming in Ruby using Combinator Birds](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/tree/master/2008-11-07/from_birds_that_compose_to_method_advice.markdown#readme), [The Enchaining and Obdurate Kestrels](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/tree/master/2008-11-12/the_obdurate_kestrel.md#readme), [Finding Joy in Combinators](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/tree/master/2008-11-16/joy.md#readme), [Refactoring Methods with Recursive Combinators](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/tree/master/2008-11-23/recursive_combinators.md#readme), [Practical Recursive Combinators](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/tree/master/2008-11-26/practical_recursive_combinators.md#readme), [The Hopelessly Egocentric Blog Post](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/tree/master/2009-02-02/hopeless_egocentricity.md#readme), and [Wrapping Combinators](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/tree/master/2009-06-29/wrapping_combinators.md#readme).

More than a few people suggested I write a book about combinators in Ruby, so I adapted the blog posts into [Kestrels, Quirky Birds, and Hopeless Egocentricity](http://leanpub.com/combinators).
